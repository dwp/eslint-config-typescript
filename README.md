# @dwp/eslint-config-typescript

Shareable [`eslint`](http://eslint.org) config enforcing our lint and style convention for typescript projects.

This extends the base ruleset available at `@dwp/eslint-base-config`.

## Getting started

```sh
npm install --save-dev @dwp/eslint-config-typescript eslint
```

## Rules

Add an `.eslintrc.js` file that looks something like:

```js
module.exports = require('@dwp/eslint-config-typescript');
```

You can add your own rules to enhance this, but in doing so please ensure you don't weaken the baseline ruleset.

Don't use `.eslintrc` (low precedence) or `package.json` (even lower, and just plain bad!), lest you incur the wrath of a patient adversary.

## Linting

Add `eslint` to your test suite like this, or see our [package.json](package.json) for an example of how we do it:

```json
"test": "eslint . --ext .ts,.js"
```

## Releasing

To cut a release of the project:

```bash
git checkout -b chore/package
npx standard-version
git push -u origin head
```

And follow the usual MR process.
